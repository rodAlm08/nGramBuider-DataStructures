Main Assignment â€“ N-Gram Frequency Builder
The program has 5 options menu:
(1) Specify Text File Directory
(2) Specify n-Gram Size
(3) Specify Output File
(4) Build n-Grams
(5) Quit
For menu option (3) the user does not need to put .csv as it will be checked.
For menu option (4) to build the n-Grams I have added an option to add or not the probability of appearance for each n-Grams to the outputted file.
The process bar will load accordingly to the size of each file and at the end I have added a summary table.
